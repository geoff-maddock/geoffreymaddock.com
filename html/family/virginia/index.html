            <p>
                Virginia Dell Craig, age 82 of Tallahassee, FL (formerly of Pittsburgh, PA) died
peacefully in Big Bend Hospice on November 1, 2024 She is survived by her niece
Ellen Maddock (Valerie Gortmaker) , nephew Geoffrey Maddock (Cassandra
Stevens), brother-in-law Robert Maddock., and numerous cousins. She is
predeceased by her twin sister, Nancy Ann Maddock and parents Willmot and
Virginia Dell Craig.
            </p>
            <p>
                Virginia spent most of her working life at West Penn Hospital as the program
director of the Benedum School of Medical Technology. She moved to Tallahassee in
1994 where she worked for Tallahassee Memorial Hospital until her retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Virginia loved to explore the natural world, a nature enthusiast that was able to
identify almost any wildflower or butterfly. She took great joy in finding and
photographing flowers, spending many days exploring the Apalachicola National
Forest and wilds of Florida., She was also a prolific maker of beautiful handmade
books,. In her younger years she was an avid yoga practitioner.  In her retirement years she volunteered with the American Red Cross and
butterfly conservation efforts, and was an member of the Florida Native Plant
Society.
            </p>
            <p>
                A celebration of life will be planned for a later date, I encourage those that loved
Virginia to spend a day appreciating the natural world as she did with a sense of
wonder and awe. In lieu of flowers, charitable donations can be made to Birdsong
Nature Center (www.birdsongnaturecenter.org)

The Summer Day

Who made the world?
Who made the swan, and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?
This grasshopper, I mean —
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down —
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.
I don&#39;t know exactly what a prayer is.
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me, what else should I have done?
Doesn&#39;t everything die at last, and too soon?
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?
- Mary Oliver
