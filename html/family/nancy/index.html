                Nancy Maddock, born Nancy Craig, passed away peacefully on Friday October 25th 2024 surrounded by
                family. Born in Houston, Texas in 1942 to Wilmot and Virginia Craig, Nancy led a life full of warmth,
                care, and devotion to her family and community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nancy graduated from Texas Woman's University with a degree in Microbiology. She worked for many years
                at the West Penn Hospital Microbiology Lab in Pittsburgh, where her expertise and dedication were valued
                by her colleagues. After taking time off to raise her children, she returned to her work in microbiology
                until her retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1975, Nancy married Bob Maddock, and together they built a loving home in Pittsburgh, raising two
                children, Geoffrey and Ellen. A master homemaker, Nancy excelled in creating simple yet delicious meals,
                preserving family recipes, and experimenting with new ones from her favorite cookbooks. She was also a
                talented seamstress, making clothes and costumes for her family and, in later years, crafting colorful
                quilts for friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nancy was an active member of the Community of Reconciliation Church and a dedicated volunteer, leading
                the Campfire Boys and Girls and helping children with reading challenges. She was a lifelong learner and
                avid leader, with a deep love for science, biographies, and mystery novels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nancy will be remembered for her incredible organizational skills, her kind and caring nature, and her
                love of peace and the natural world. She believed in the power of science, faith, and the human spirit
                to make the world a better place.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is survived by her beloved husband Bob, her son Geoffrey and his partner Cassie, her daughter Ellen
                and wife Val, her twin sister Virginia and is remembered fondly by family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                The family will be having a remembrance ceremony at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family
                requests donations be made to Brother's Brother Charity (<a
                    href="https://brothersbrother.org/">https://brothersbrother.org/</a>) in honor of Nancy’s commitment
                to helping others.
